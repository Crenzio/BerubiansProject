            <div class="text">

                We're a small community black-box theater that's always on the hunt for new talent and new audience members.

                <br />
                <br /> We believe that the primary duty of a community theater is to supports its performs, writers, and directors.

                <br />
                <br /> We welcome veterans and newcomers alike. We love helping new actors get started, and helping veteran actors
                further refine their talents. As a matter of principal,
                <strong>we never charge our actors dues or fees</strong> (nor do we make them buy anything, subscribe to anything,
                or pay us in any other obscure way).

                <br />
                <br /> If you're an actor who's interested in performing with us, keep any eye on our
                <a href="/auditions" class="top">Auditions Page</a>, or join our mailing list, to keep abrest of new opportunities to act on our stage.

                <br />
                <br /> But we do more than support actors. We also take every opportunity to provide writers, directors, and stand-up
                comedians with a place to put on a their shows.

                <br />
                <br /> If you're a stand-up comedian in need of a place to perform, a writer with a script that needs a home, or
                a director lookiing for a show to run, ask about
