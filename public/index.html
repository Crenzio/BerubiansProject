            <h3 class="text">Welcome to the Berubian Theater</h3>

            <div class="text">

                We're a community black-box theater that's always on the hunt for new talent and new audiences.

                <br />
                <br /> We believe that the primary duty of a community theater is to support its performs, writers, and directors.
                And we never take that responsibility lightly.

                <br />
                <br /> We welcome veterans and newcomers alike. We love helping new actors get started, and helping veteran actors
                further refine their talents. As a matter of principal,
                <strong>we never charge our performers dues or fees</strong> (nor do we make them pay us in any other way).

                <br />
                <br /> If you're an actor who's interested in performing with us, keep any eye on our
                <a href="/auditions" class="top">Auditions Page</a>, join our
                <a href="/mail" class="top">Mailing List</a>, or follow us on
                <a href="/social" class="top">Social Media</a>.

                <br />
                <br /> But we do more than support actors. We also take every opportunity to provide writers, directors, and stand-up
                comedians with a place to put on their shows.

                <br />
                <br /> Are you a comedian looking for a place to perform? A director looking for a show to run? A teacher who needs
                space for a workshop? Or someone looking to host an event? Well, then ask about
                <a href="/rent" class="top">Renting Our Space</a>.

                <br />
                <br /> If you're an aspiring performer looking to sharpen your skills, or an enthusiast who just wants to hang
                out and do improv, then take a look at our
                <a href="/classes" class="top">Classes</a>.

                <br />
                <br /> Everyone else, take a look at the
                <a href="/shows" class="top">Shows</a> we have playing.
