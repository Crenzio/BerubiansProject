        Once the app goes live (this Heroku server is merely providing a demo), admins will be able to quickly add/remove shows from schedules
        via private admin tool pages. Show schedules will then populate on this page.

        <br />
        <br /> Shows will be listed chronologically (separated by month) on this page, and will be automatically removed when their
        air-date passes. It will be possible to attach images to individual show posts.
