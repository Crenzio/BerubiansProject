        This Heroku demo does not contain the tools which will allow admins to call/edit database entries. As such, show schedules
        are not currently populating.

        <br />
        <br /> In the final live version, however, admins will be able to quickly add/remove shows from schedules via private admin
        tool pages. Show schedules will then populate on this page.

        <br />
        <br /> Shows will be listed chronologically (separated by month) on this page and will be automatically removed when their
        air-date passes. It will be possible to attach images to individual posts.
