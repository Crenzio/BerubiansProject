        To avoid unintentionally accumulating Heroku server costs and confusing clients with sample schedules, this demo does not
        make calls to the Berubain Theater's database. As such, schedules are not currently populating.

        <br />
        <br /> Once the app goes live, however, admins will be able to quickly add/remove shows from schedules via private admin
        tool pages. Show schedules will then populate on this page.

        <br />
        <br /> Shows will be listed chronologically (separated by month) on this page and will be automatically removed when their
        air-date passes. It will be possible to attach images to individual posts.
